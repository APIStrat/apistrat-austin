<p>The API podcast “Traffic and Weather” returns for the third time to APIStrat this November with a new live show.</p>
<p>Hosted by John Sheehan (Runscope) and Steve Marx (Dropbox), <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a> is a witty and engaging roundup of API breaking news and current practices, with clever insights and clear pointers to must-reads across the API landscape.</p>
<p>Having hosted crowd-pleasing shows at APIStrat in San Francisco and Chicago, Traffic and Weather will return to our Austin stage for their third show. Their live podcast from our main stage gets the audience buzzing and is a great talking point amongst delegates for the rest of our event. We are excited and grateful to welcome John and Steve back again.</p>
<p>As with their previous gigs, Traffic and Weather Austin will include audience participation and guest interviewees, and summarize the latest coding dilemmas and business movements in a lighthearted look at the API industry.</p>
<p>At APIStrat Chicago, audience members were invited to complete API-themed limericks, share insights on when an IoT API is not all that necessary (tennis racquets anyone?), and answer groan-inducing puns in a ‘Lightning Fill in the Blanks’ round of quizzes.</p>
<p>Aside from the fun take on all things API, Traffic and Weather does a great job of summarizing some of the latest trends and thought leadership in the API space. Their most recent podcast from April included a look at API tools that help developers build better software, an in-depth look at how Swagger’s move to SmartBear and how the Swagger community can be quantified, HTTP status codes, and authentication. In the hands (or voices?) of John and Steve, some of these seemingly dry topics come alive and encourage you to dig deeper into thinking about your API code and your API business strategy.</p>
<p>Catch up with their previous shows at APIStrat:</p>
<p>insert San Francisco and Chicago youtube embeds?</p>
<p>We can’t wait to see what John and Steve come up with next. Get ready to jump in and volunteer for the quizzes, and remember to bring a raincoat if you are sitting in the front row!</p>
