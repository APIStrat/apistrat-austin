<p>It is that time again...the APIStrat experience. After an exiting, sold out APIDays Berlin &amp; APIStrat Europe 2015 in Berlin, we are moving the conversation to Austin, TX. We are happy to announce APIStrat Austin, at the&nbsp;Sheraton Austin Hotel At The Capitol, this November 18th, 19th, and 20th 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the sixth edition of APIStrat, we are keeping to our roots, with a three day conversation focused on the opportunities, and challenges faced by API providers today. The event will bring together API experts, practitioners, developers, and business folk, to share their stories from the trenches. No special theme, just the important conversations about what is impacting the space in 2015.</p>
<p>Over the couple weeks we will open up the call for papers, share the topics for some of the topics we have in mind for some of the tracks, and share some of the ideas we have planned for this edition. We are extremely excited for the amount of enthusiasm we have on the ground in Austin, resulting in the city being selected. We look forward to making this a uniquely Austin API conversation.</p>
<p>APIStrat Austin is going to be an intimate conversation between no more than 400 people from the space, so make sure you get involved early. Contact us if you are interested in sponsoring, or supporting in any way, and make sure your company is part of the conversation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The APIStrat team looks forward to seeing you in Austin!</p>
